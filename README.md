# Noliter

Write code with no literal and get tiny bundle.  
This is very experimental project for maximizing mangle.

Instead of literal, if you use constant, you can reduce your file size.  
Please setting about mangle, then your constants will change to single alphabet.

## Install

```
npm i -D noliter
```

## API

- [Supported constants](./dist/Constant.d.ts)
- [DOM manipulation functions](./dist/Element.d.ts)
